# PortSwigger Labs

A collection of solutions, payloads, and automation scripts for **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** labs.  
Folders are compact, well-documented, and suitable for portfolio use to demonstrate practical automation and web-security skills.

## Purpose
This repo is a personal archive and demonstration of automated approaches to web-based challenge solving.  
It shows how I structure per-level solutions, the automation scripts I use to speed repetitive tasks, and concise notes that explain each approach.
