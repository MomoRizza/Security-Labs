# Natas Challenges

A collection of solutions, automation scripts, and notes for the **Natas** wargame (OverTheWire).  
This repository groups each level into its own folder containing solver code, payloads, and a short writeup so it's easy to browse and reuse automation techniques.

## Purpose
This repo is a personal archive and demonstration of automated approaches to web-based challenge solving.  
It shows how I structure per-level solutions, the automation scripts I use to speed repetitive tasks, and concise notes that explain each approach.
